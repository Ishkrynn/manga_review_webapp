# Manga Library and Review Webapp

This webapp will allow users to create a library of the manga that they have read or liked. 

Users can create an account, add a manga title and author/artist, as well as write a review for the manga.

# Tech Stack
Python-Django
SQLite

# Planned Features
I'm planning on adding more user facing features, such as the ability to view other users' manga libraries and reviews, as well as a rating system. Further down the line I'd like to add the ability to follow/unfollow other users and maybe even allow users to add posts to their profiles that their followers can see.

# How to run this app
For now, this app can only be run locally. You will need to install python-django to be able to run a local server on your machine.

# References
I'm using Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course as a reference to build this webapp. I am currently learning Django through the project in his book.
